This Repository has everything I have made while on my way to learn REACT Js.

Small Projects made =>

1. Counter -> This was the very first react project where i built a basic counter button.
2. Card Trial -> This project taugth me how to reuse components in react.
3. Background Changer -> This was my first project after i got my hands on HOOKs in react. I used useState hook to change the bg colour of the page on  clicking of respective color button. By default the page loads on olive color.
4. Password Generator -> In this project I used hooks to randomly generate password of the desired length that the user can choose using the slider. User also get to choose if they need numbers and charecter in the password. The generated password can then be copied to the clipboard that can be kept for further use.
5. Currency Converter -> In this project I used other hooks to convert the amount in specific currency into another. I also built a custom hook for it which fetch the data from API.
6. Router Page ->
